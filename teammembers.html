        <p class="description">As a starter it seems quite fun creating websites. This is my first ever experience. I want to start with saying that my interest in computers started with videogames. I used to be obsessed with videogames back when I was very young, and now, here I am studying computer science! I remember as a kid, always wondering how the very thing I have been obsessing over even operates? As the very curious kid that I was, I would always try to find ways to learn more about my obsession, computers. When deciding which path to go for, I felt like all that curiosity that I had as a kid, suddenly came back. At that moment, I knew exactly what to choose.</p>

        <p class="description">Hi, my name is Turan Ahmadli. I am a future Electric and Electronical engineer. The reason for selecting this field is that I am interested in mechanical tools since my childhood. I'm excited to learn more about electricity and electronics and maybe even create some cool innovations of my own. Starting to create websites sounds really cool. However, this is my second experience. Because I am retaking this course.</p>

        <p class="description">Hi, my name is Ziyaddin Musayev. I am a competitive athlete and Computer Science student at ADA University. From a young age, I like to build and create stuff. That is one of the main reasons that I'm interested in web development and programming. In those fields I'm using my knowledge to build new projects, especially the ones that can be useful and be used in sports. I have several projects in which I chose to participate in several science fairs. From all these interests I'm studying computer science, to know more about computers and programming.</p>

        <p class="description">Hey, my name is Laman Ahmadova. I am a Computer Engineer major, and I am fascinated by the way things work. My story goes all the way to my childhood when I would take electric car toys apart just to understand how they work. As I grew older, I would take them apart when they were not working and fixing them. Of course, I wouldn't be able to fix all of them (RIP) but I tried to do my best. The reason I chose CE instead of Electrical Engineering is because I also love codding. If you are trying to find your future career, you should definitely take a look back at your childhood!</p>
